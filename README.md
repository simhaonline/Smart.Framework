### Smart.Framework design philosophy:
* A very **pragmatic** and practical aproach: **A Practical Web Framework for Practical People**
* Based on a previous **experience of more than 17 years** of developing web projects, research and experiments using web technologies
* Web oriented approach: to offer **a solid and secure platform** for building websites or web based applications for Web Clients, Desktops and Mobiles
* Clean Code: **MVC code pattern** with built-in Dependency-Injection
* **Hybrid** Architecture: **Multi-Tier combined with Middlewares architecture** to provide a flexible and responsive web service
* **Modular Architecture**: **support creating reusable modules** (there are also many turn-key modules available in Smart.Framework.Modules)
* **Full Decoupled Libraries**: the framework core is using independent (decoupled) libraries (**no 3rd party dependencies**)
* **NameSpace Separation in modules** for: Models, Views, Controllers and Libraries
* **Easy to integrate** with 3rd party (vendor) libraries
* Native **Cloud Server Services (built-in)**, as module for: WebDAV Server, CalDAV Server, CardDAV Server
* Native **Cloud Client Provider (built-in)**, as library for HTTP/HTTPS access which supports the full range of HTTP(S) Methods / Requests: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, ...
* **Native Router** based on smart URL Links: **/?page=my-module.sample** that can be used as **/?/page/my-module.sample** or **/?/page/sample** if (my-module is default bundle)
* Integrates with **Apache Rewrite** to use SEO friendly links like **/sample.html** instead of traditional link **/?page=my-module.sample** or smart link **/?/page/my-module.sample/**

#### Easy develop your web projects with Smart.Framework
**The primary goal of Smart.Framework is to provide a very practical, fast and secure web framework.**
Following this philosophy Smart.Framework provides an optimal balance between acceptable coding skills and performance delivered.

It is a **lightweight but feature reach** PHP / JavaScript web framework, **mature and stable**, it is being **proactively used and tested** in several high-end web projects **that can really serve many millions of page views per month with a single physical server** !
The original software architecture of this web framework allows it to deliver a paradox:
* it have more default built-in features in the code base than the well-known frameworks compared with Symfony, Laravel or Zend Framework
* it delivers much more performance being between 3x to 4x faster (as HTTP Requests / second) compared with Symfony, Laravel or Zend Framework
* when used with Persistent Cache based on In-Memory DB like Redis or Memcache it beats Varnish in many aspects:
	- delivers ~ the same speed as Varnish but allows granulary level caching policy of zones in controllers
	- works also with HTTPS (by example, Varnish does not)
	- caching policies can be controlled to expire based on content / GET or POST variables INPUT even with changing COOKIES


#### This software framework is compatible, stable and actively tested with PHP 7.2 / 7.3 / 7.4 versions.
**Prefered PHP versions** are: **7.2 / 7.3** which are currently LTS.

### Benchmark Scenario:
**Using a simple controller (no Caching) that Outputs: 'Hello World'**
The benchmark was running using *Apache Benchmark* suite with the following command:
*ab -n 5000 -c 250 http://{localhost}/{framework}/{benchmark-page}*

**Hardware platform**: one physical server (Supermicro):
* **2 x Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2699 v4** @ 2.20GHz 64-bit (Total: 44 cores / 88 threads)
* **256 GB RAM**, DDR4 ECC @ 2133 MHz
* **HDD 2 x 1TB** SSD/NVME

**Software**:
* OS: **Debian 10 Linux 64-bit**, up-to-date 2020-06-03
* Apps: **Apache 2.4.43**, **PHP 7.3.18 with Opcache enabled**

#### Benchmark Results of tested PHP Frameworks:
* **Smart.Framework v.5.7.2 head@2020.06.03** with MarkersTPL Templating: ~ **_8.77K_** (8771) *requests per second*
* **CodeIgniter v.4.0** with PHP Templating: ~ **_5.38K_** (5378) *requests per second* ( **1.3x slower than Smart.Framework** )
* **Symfony 4.4.2** with Twig Templating: ~ **_1.54K_** (1532) *requests per second* ( **5x slower than Smart.Framework** )
* **Laravel 6** with Blade Templating ~ **_1.33K_** (1323) *requests per second* ( **6x slower than Smart.Framework** )
* **Zend Framework 3** with PHP Templating: ~ **_1.16K_** (1175) *requests per second* ( **7x slower than Smart.Framework** )
